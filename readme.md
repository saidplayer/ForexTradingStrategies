# Forex Trading Strategies
In this repository I put the Forex trading codes in MQL4. The language is based on C, and runs on MetaTrader application. When loaded on top of a chart, it will monitor prices and send orders when conditions are all good. It also performs continuous trailing. Most of the settings of the indicators are configurable, and well docoumented in the code.

## Performance and Optimization through Backtest

Performance of the strategies based on RSI, MACD and Fair Value Gap indicators are explained and tested in the following:

1) [**RSI and MACD combination**](https://drsoli.com/index.php/2023/04/22/forex-01-diversification-with-rsi-and-macd-mql4-metatrader/)

2) [**My YouTube video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w5A0cl3uMk) on coding and back testing Fair Value Gap, and combining it with RSI and MACD.

## RSI indicator
### Definition
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp))

### RSI level trading
Over-bought and over-sold markets are two states derived from RSI indicator reaching above 70% or below 30%, respectively. These are signals for potential signals for trend reversal and SHORT and LONG entry, respectively.

### RSI Divergence
This is a famous momentum trading indicator. The strong one indicator signals a BUY, when the price chart forms a lower low, while the RSI indicator shows a higher low, as in the figure below. The opposite is true for a SELL signal: when the price forms a higher high, while RSI forms a lower high.

## MACD indicator
### Definition
Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify market entry points for buying or selling. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a securityâ€™s price. MACD was developed in the 1970s by Gerald Appel. ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp))

### MACD Crossover
MACD has two moving averages, called MACD and Signal. MACD crossing over the Signal line, signals a LONG entry point. The opposite, would be a SHORT entry signal.

### MACD Divergence
This is almost similar to the RSI divergence case, as in the figure below. MACD and RSI divergence occuring at the same time, is known as a strong trend reversal and entry signal by some.

## Fair Value Gap
This trading signal is based on the belief that: when price experiences a large gap starting a new trend, it will soon return and fill the gap, and then continue the initiated trend with a stronger momentum.
